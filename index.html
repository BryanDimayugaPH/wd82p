        <h1>Self Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm thrilled to introduce myself as an Electrical Engineering graduate with a passion for data analysis. My name is Bryan M. Dimayuga and I'm excited to share a bit about my background and interests.
            I recently completed my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, where I developed a strong foundation in various aspects of the field, including circuit design, power systems, and simulations. Throughout my academic journey, I acquired a deep understanding of the principles and concepts that govern electrical systems, and I enjoyed exploring their applications in real-world scenarios.
            While pursuing my degree, I discovered my affinity for working with data. I realized that I had a natural curiosity for extracting insights and patterns from large datasets, which led me to explore the field of data analysis. To enhance my skills in this area, I took additional courses in statistics, data mining, and programming languages like Python and SQL. These experiences provided me with a solid understanding of data analysis techniques, data visualization, and data-driven decision-making.
            As a data analyst, I believe in the power of data to drive informed decision-making and improve processes. I enjoy diving into complex datasets, identifying trends, and extracting meaningful insights to support strategic decision-making. I am skilled in using various analytical tools and programming languages to manipulate and analyze data effectively. Additionally, I have experience with data visualization tools to communicate findings in a clear and concise manner.
            I'm highly motivated, detail-oriented, and have excellent problem-solving skills, which I honed during my engineering education. I thrive in a collaborative environment and enjoy working with cross-functional teams to tackle challenges and achieve goals.
            In summary, my background in Electrical Engineering combined with my expertise in data analysis positions me to contribute effectively in roles where analytical thinking and technical knowledge are required. I'm eager to apply my skills and contribute to projects that involve leveraging data to drive meaningful insights and optimize processes.
