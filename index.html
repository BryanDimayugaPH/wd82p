        <h1>Self Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm thrilled to introduce myself as an Electrical Engineering graduate with a passion for data analysis. My name is Bryan M. Dimayuga and I'm excited to share a bit about my background and interests.
            I recently completed my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, where I developed a strong foundation in various aspects of the field, including circuit design, power systems, and simulations. Throughout my academic journey, I acquired a deep understanding of the principles and concepts that govern electrical systems, and I enjoyed exploring their applications in real-world scenarios.
            While pursuing my degree, I discovered my affinity for working with data. I realized that I had a natural curiosity for extracting insights and patterns from large datasets, which led me to explore the field of data analysis. To enhance my skills in this area, I took additional courses in statistics, data mining, and programming languages like Python and SQL. These experiences provided me with a solid understanding of data analysis techniques, data visualization, and data-driven decision-making.
